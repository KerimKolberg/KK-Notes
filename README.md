# InkingCanvas

A standalone, low-latency inking surface for React + TypeScript, tuned for
2-in-1 pen/touch laptops. Full-viewport HTML5 canvas, high-DPI aware, with
palm rejection, pressure-sensitive strokes via [perfect-freehand], and an
undo/redo stack.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Vite dev server
npm test           # unit tests (vitest)
npm run typecheck  # strict tsc
npm run build      # typecheck + production bundle
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { InkingCanvas, type InkingCanvasHandle, type Stroke } from './inking';

function Page() {
  const ink = useRef<InkingCanvasHandle>(null);
  return (
    <div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
      <InkingCanvas
        ref={ink}
        initialSettings={{ tool: 'pen', color: '#1f1f24', size: 4 }}
        onStrokesChange={(strokes: readonly Stroke[]) => save(strokes)}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The component fills its parent, so size the parent (the demo `App` uses the
whole viewport). `ref` exposes `undo()`, `redo()`, `clear()`, `getStrokes()`
and `toDataURL()`.

| Prop | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `initialStrokes` | `[]` | Seed strokes (uncontrolled) |
| `onStrokesChange` | – | Fired after every committed change |
| `initialSettings` | pen, 4 px, dark grey | Initial toolbar state |
| `showToolbar` | `true` | Render the built-in toolbar |
| `allowMouse` | `true` | Let a mouse draw (desktop convenience) |
| `background` | `#ffffff` | Colour behind the ink, also used by `toDataURL` |
| `maxHistory` | `200` | Undo depth |

Keyboard: `Ctrl/⌘+Z` undo, `Ctrl/⌘+Shift+Z` or `Ctrl+Y` redo.

## Tools

| Tool | Gesture | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pen | freehand | pressure-thinned perfect-freehand polygon |
| Highlighter | freehand | 4× width, `multiply` at 35 % |
| Line | drag | straight segment / vector |
| Axes | drag from the origin | coordinate plane |
| Stroke eraser | sweep | removes whole strokes |
| Pixel eraser | freehand | `destination-out` stroke |

Every ink tool shares the toolbar's **pattern** (solid, dashed, dotted,
dash-dot, long dash) and **arrowhead** mode (off, end, both). **15° snap**
constrains lines and vectors to 15° increments; **Hold to snap** turns a
freehand stroke into a primitive when you pause at its end.

### Hold to snap

Keep the pen still (within 5 px) for one second before lifting it and the
raw preview is replaced by the recognised shape, which is what gets
committed. `engine/shapeRecognition.ts`:

1. Reject paths with a bounding diagonal under 8 px.
2. **Line** when the chord covers ≥ 60 % of the path and no sample deviates
   from it by more than 6 % of its length.
3. Resample to uniform arc length, then split on whether the endpoints meet.
4. Closed paths: fit an ellipse by PCA; in that ellipse's unit frame run
   corner detection (RDP on the ring + merge + collinear pruning) so any
   ellipse looks like a circle (≥ 7 vertices) while polygons keep their true
   corner count. Accept **circle / ellipse** when the normalised radial
   coefficient of variation is below 0.1. Otherwise **heart** (two lobes, a
   notch ≥ 12 % of the height, bottom point centred), **rectangle** (four
   corners within 20° of right angles → oriented fit, snapped to the bounding
   box when within 8° of the axes), or an n-gon **polygon** (3–8 corners:
   triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon…).
5. Open paths: RDP with 5 % of the diagonal; 3–6 vertices with no segment
   shorter than 10 % of the length become a **polyline** (L, V, Z shapes).

### Angle HUD

While a line is being dragged (or previewed by hold-to-snap) the live layer
shows `θ = 45.0°` from the horizontal in math convention (y up), an
interior-angle arc `∠ = …` wherever an end sits on an existing line or
polyline endpoint (within 14 px), and the acute angle at each crossing with
one. Nothing from the HUD is committed.

### Coordinate plane

Pointer-down is the origin; the drag distance sets the half-axis extents.
*Quadrant I* grows up and right, *4 quadrants* mirrors both axes. The second
toolbar row configures divisions per half-axis, the faint grid, numbered
ticks and the axis labels (with presets such as `t / y`, `σ / jω`, `Re / Im`,
`Q / P`). Axes, ticks, arrowheads and labels are drawn as vectors and text
directly on the canvas.

## How it works

**Two stacked canvases.** `committed` holds finished strokes and is only
touched when history changes: appending a stroke draws just that stroke;
undo, erase and resize replay the list. `live` shows the stroke in progress
and is cleared and repainted once per `requestAnimationFrame` from all the
samples received since the previous frame. Both contexts are created with
`desynchronized: true` so Chromium can present outside the compositor's vsync.

**High-DPI.** A `ResizeObserver` (preferring `device-pixel-content-box`)
sizes the backing stores to `css × devicePixelRatio` (capped at 3×) and
installs a matching `setTransform`, so every drawing routine works in CSS
pixels and stored strokes are resolution-independent. `touch-action: none`
on the surface hands every gesture to the pointer handlers.

**Stylus & palm rejection** (`engine/pointerPolicy.ts`, pure and unit-tested).
Pen input always draws. Touch draws only when the *Touch Draw* toggle is on
and no pen has been seen for 700 ms; a pen flagged as hovering blocks touch
until it leaves (or the flag goes stale after 3 s). A pen landing while a
finger stroke is in progress discards that stroke. Pressure is clamped to
`(0, 1]` with `0` mapped to `0.5`. The pen's eraser end, or barrel button
while touching, temporarily selects the stroke eraser. `getCoalescedEvents()`
recovers the full 240 Hz sample stream, and pointer capture keeps strokes
alive past the element edge.

**Strokes.** `Stroke` is a union of `FreehandStroke` (raw samples) and
`GeometricStroke` (a `Shape`: line, polyline, polygon, rectangle, ellipse,
heart or coordinate plane). Both carry the same frozen `StrokeStyle`, so the
history reducer, hit-testing and rendering treat them uniformly.

- Solid freehand strokes go through perfect-freehand's `getStroke`
  (`engine/strokeOutline.ts`): streamline the input, derive a per-point
  radius from pressure (or from velocity for pointers without a sensor),
  offset left/right along the normal, and fill the resulting polygon with
  `nonzero` winding.
- Dashed/dotted freehand strokes and every geometric primitive are **stroked
  paths**: the centreline is RDP-simplified and resampled at equal arc-length
  spacing (`engine/simplify.ts`), then drawn with `ctx.stroke()`, round caps
  and `setLineDash` (a near-zero dash with round caps produces dots).
- Arrowheads are filled triangles placed on the tangent estimated over the
  trailing 12 px of the path; stroked shafts are trimmed under the head so
  translucent ink never shows through.

Render plans (`Path2D` objects) for committed strokes are memoised in a
`WeakMap`; the coordinate plane is drawn directly since it mixes line widths
and text.

**Tools.**

- *Pen* – `source-over`, `thinning 0.6`.
- *Highlighter* – 4× width, constant, `multiply` at 35 % opacity. While the
  stroke is live the `live` canvas gets `mix-blend-mode: multiply` so the
  preview matches the committed result.
- *Pixel eraser* – a stroke rendered with `destination-out`. It is stored in
  history like any other stroke, so undo/redo replay it naturally. Because
  `destination-out` is invisible on the transparent preview layer it paints
  straight onto `committed` while live (re-applying the same outline on
  commit is idempotent; a cancel triggers a replay).
- *Stroke eraser* – hit-tests the eraser sweep against every stroke with a
  segment-to-segment distance test (`engine/hitTest.ts`), hides hits during
  the drag and removes them as one undoable action on release.

**History** (`engine/history.ts`). A command stack: `add` stores the stroke,
`remove` stores strokes with their original indices, `clear` stores the list.
Undo inverts, redo re-applies, depth is capped.
